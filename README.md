# vins-mono-euroc-evaluation
This repository contains a production-ready implementation of a Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) pipeline using VINS-Mono. The system is designed to estimate the state (position and orientation) of a drone in GPS-denied environments using only a monocular camera and an IMU.
